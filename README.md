## About

Hive.go is a shared library that is used in the GoShimmer and Hornet node software. This library contains shared:
* Data structures
* Utility methods
* Abstractions

This is beta software, so there may be performance and stability issues.
Please report any issues in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/iotaledger/hive.go/issues/new).

## Prerequisites

To use the library, you need to have at least [version 1.13 of Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) installed on your device.

To check if you have Go installed, run the following command:

```bash
go version
```

If Go is installed, you should see the version that's installed.

## Installation

To install Hive.go and its dependencies, you can use one of the following options:

* If you use Go modules, just import the packages that you want to use

    ```bash
    import (
    "github.com/iotaledger/hive.go/logger"
    "github.com/iotaledger/hive.go/node"
    "github.com/iotaledger/iota.go/trinary"
    )
    ```

* To download the library from GitHub, use the `go get` command

    ```bash
    go get github.com/iotaledger/hive.go
    ```

## Getting started

After you've [installed the library](#installation), you can use it in your project.

For example, to create a new `logger` instance:

```js
import "github.com/iotaledger/hive.go/logger"

log = logger.NewLogger('myNewLoggerName')
```

### Activating deadlock detection

To replace the mutexes in the `syncutils` package with [Go deadlock](https://github.com/sasha-s/go-deadlock), use the `deadlock` build flag when compiling your program.
